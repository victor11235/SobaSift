# SobaSift

[SobaSift](https://sobasift.vercel.app) is an email assistant that utilizes trained topic models to put users' incoming emails into folders automatically. The training is done by collecting existing emails from the folders, and update the topic model stored on our server. Here is a diagram of how SobaSift works:

We have mainly used [supabase](https://supabase.com) to build SobaSift on cloud. To demonstrate SobaSift's functionality, we have created a demo video for its use in helping people in academia.
